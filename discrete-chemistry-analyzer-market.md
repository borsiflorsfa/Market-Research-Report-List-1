<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Discrete Chemistry Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flow Cell Based System</li><li>Direct Read System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The discrete chemistry analyzer market can be categorized into two main types: flow cell-based systems and direct read systems. Flow cell-based systems utilize a continuous stream of samples that flow through a cuvette for analysis, allowing for automated processing and high throughput. In contrast, direct read systems analyze individual samples without requiring flow, typically offering faster results for specific tests. Both systems enhance laboratory efficiency but differ in their operational methodologies and application suitability.</p></p>
