<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Alloy Extrusion Profiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forward Extrusion</li><li>Backward Extrusion</li><li>Composite Extrusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aluminum alloy extrusion profiles are categorized into three primary types: forward extrusion, backward extrusion, and composite extrusion. In forward extrusion, the aluminum billet is pushed through a die, resulting in a continuous profile. Backward extrusion, on the other hand, involves pulling the material back into the chamber, creating hollow profiles. Composite extrusion combines different materials or alloys during the process, allowing for enhanced properties and performance. Each method serves distinct applications in industries like construction, automotive, and aerospace.</p></p>
